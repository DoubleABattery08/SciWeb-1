the derive(/derive) feature, where the user is guided towards discovering
 the concepts and deriving the formulas. Here they use inductive reasoning
to gain a conceptual understanding of the content, which is represented in
a concept map(/Maps). Next is the Levels feature, which has the user
employ the concepts they derived to solve a wide range of practice
problems directly related to the concepts. This tests the user's
adaptability and creative thinking. Progress is represented on the
map, and error analysis is used to promote efficient and effective
learning. Lastly is the Evaluate feature, which tests test-taking
skills under time pressure with complex, wide ranging problems like
 those on an exam. Users can modify the length, difficulty, and time
  allotment, while never seeing the same question twice.
