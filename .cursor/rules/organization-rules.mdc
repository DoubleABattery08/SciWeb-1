All html files go in templates folder, all js/css files go directly into static folder
For AI functions, all prompts go in [prompts.py](mdc:prompts.py), pydantic models go in [models.py](mdc:models.py), call model in [study.py](mdc:study.py), and use output processor in [output_processor.py](mdc:output_processor.py) if needed.
Every Page should have 1 html file, 1 js file, and 1 css file
Always fetch sheets on the frontend and then pass it into the backend to utilize the cache
