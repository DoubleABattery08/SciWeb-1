Make an LLM todolist page that creates an omnidirectional scrollable div with a treelike structure. 
Every node is either a motivator, Goal, or Task. Each node has it's own LLM conversation in it,
that opens into fullscreen mode on node click. Each subnode breaks off of it's parent node add
a given message in the parent node's conversation. Each node takes as context the entire
conversation in that node, plus the conversation prior to the breakoff point in it's parent,
and it's parent's parent, etc. As an example, set getting into college as a motivator, and
beneath that Grades and Extracurriculars as motivators. Then add Goals and tasks in a tree
like structure expanding in width below those. Style it nicely and intuitively. No backend
needed for now
