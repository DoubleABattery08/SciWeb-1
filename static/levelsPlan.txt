Visual Progress Indicators
A glowing halo/aura around each node that represents mastery level
Color intensity and size of the halo could indicate proficiency
Different colors could represent different states:
Dim/No halo: Not yet attempted
Orange halo: Just starting (0-40% mastery)
Yellow halo: Making progress (40-70% mastery)
Blue halo: Good understanding (70-90% mastery)
Bright white/gold halo: Mastery achieved (90%+ mastery)
Progress Calculation
Track multiple factors to determine the halo intensity:
Problem completion rate for that concept
Average evaluation scores
Consistency of good explanations
Time spent on problems
Number of attempts needed to master problems
Weight recent performance more heavily than older attempts
Interactive Elements
Hovering over a node could show detailed progress stats:
"8/10 problems completed"
"85% average understanding"
"Last practiced: 2 days ago"
"Strong areas: [specific aspects]"
Clicking could show a progress history graph
Right-clicking could show recommended next steps
Dynamic Updates
Halos pulse briefly when progress is made
Smooth transitions when mastery level changes
Visual connections between related concepts could glow when prerequisites are mastered
Fading halos for concepts that haven't been practiced recently
Decay System
Halos slowly fade over time if concepts aren't practiced
This encourages regular review and practice
Could show "needs review" indicators when mastery starts to decay
Different concepts could have different decay rates based on difficulty
Achievement System
Special visual effects for achieving full mastery of a concept
Unique halo patterns for different types of achievements:
"Perfect Score" halo design
"Quick Learner" sparkle effect
"Consistent Performance" steady glow
Group achievements for mastering related concepts
