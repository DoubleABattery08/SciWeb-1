                    </header>
<p> 
    From the very start, we wanted SciWeb to be at the cutting-edge of technological development. This led us to use GPT-4 to power website stats and operations, as well as our study bot. But for us, this was just the easy part, since this technology already exists. You don't have to use SciWeb to access it. But anyone who's ever used ChatGPT knows that it's usefulness lies in how you ask a question more than its capability to respond. The more specific you are, the better. But always providing the neccessary content can be exhausting. This is why SciWeb is here to do it for you. We engineer our prompts to perfection, providing exactly the neccessary information about you to get the most accurate, tailored response- just for you!

                    </header> 
        <p> The StudyBot uses information from the class notebook to quiz the user on exactly what they need to know. There are a variety of different modes to pick from that exhibit different study techniques and will yield different results.</p>   
        
        <H3>Mode: Bloom's Taxonomy</H3>
        <p> <span class="image left"><img src="https://wordpressua.uark.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2013/09/Blooms_Taxonomy_pyramid_cake-style-use-with-permission.jpg" alt="" /></span>
            Bloom's Taxonomy was developed in 1956 as a way of organizing 
            different levels of thinking. Most people study at levels 1 and 2, 
            drilling flashcards into your head or explaining a concept to yourself. 
            But now, you can do better! The other levels of learning allow you to 
            develop a deeper understanding that is more applicable to what is asked 
            on tests. Utilizing Bloom's Taxonomy in learning ensures a comprehensive 
            understanding and the ability to apply knowledge creatively and effectively. 
            Choosing this mode will let you work through the levels of the pyramid for 
            the topics that you wish to study.</p>

             Play Dumb, aka Prompted Expanation, will have the AI ask you to explain everything
             about a concept from the ground up, as if you were teaching it to a child. Its 
             criticality will force you to think about the concept in new ways, and the AI will 
             target your misconceptions and knowledge gaps. This mode is perfect for those who 
             think they have a good understanding of a topic and want to solidify it.
